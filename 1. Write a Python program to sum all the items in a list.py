#1. Write a Python program to sum all the items in a list.
lst = []
num = int(input('How many numbers: '))
for n in range(num):
    numbers = int(input('Enter number '))
    lst.append(numbers)
print("Sum of elements in given list is :", sum(lst))


#Another Method for to get the largest number from a list.
ls=[1,2,3]
sum=0
for i in ls:
    sum=sum+i
print(sum)
